            It started with a handshake. Two visionaries, Bill Bowerman <br />
            and his University of Oregon runner Phil Knight, thought they <br />
            could do a better job of designing and selling shoes to <br />
            runners. They were right. Today Nike is the world’s leading <br />
            innovator in athletic footwear, apparel, equipment and <br />
            accessories. Along the way, Nike helped the world’s best <br />
            athletes win races, games and championships.

            True innovation isn’t just new and different. It’s new and <br />{" "}
            better. It’s surprising. Sometimes it’s shocking. Nobody does <br />{" "}
            that better than Nike. Yet we know you can’t anoint yourself <br />{" "}
            as innovative the consumer ultimately decides that for <br />{" "}
            themselves. That’s why we spend so much time with athletes <br />{" "}
            and consumers listening, observing, studying and then <br />{" "}
            creating products that enhance athletic performance and <br />{" "}
            overall consumer experiences.
